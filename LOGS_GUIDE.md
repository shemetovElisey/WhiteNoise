## Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Keep Logging Enabled** - Only disable if you're experiencing performance issues
2. **Export Logs Before Clearing** - Save important logs before clearing
3. **Use Filters** - Focus on specific components when troubleshooting
4. **Check Logs Regularly** - Monitor for warnings and errors

### For Developers
1. **Use Appropriate Log Levels** - Don't log everything as INFO
2. **Include Context** - Provide enough information to understand the issue
3. **Log Errors with Details** - Include error descriptions and stack traces
4. **Use Consistent Component Names** - Makes filtering more effective

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Logs Appearing
- Check if logging is enabled in the settings
- Restart the app to see initialization logs
- Check if the app has proper permissions

#### Performance Issues
- Reduce the maximum log entries (default: 1000)
- Clear old logs regularly
- Disable logging temporarily if needed

#### Export Failures
- Check if you have write permissions to Documents folder
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Try exporting smaller log sets

### Getting Help
When reporting issues to support:
1. Export logs with full details enabled
2. Include the time period when the issue occurred
3. Filter logs by relevant components
4. Note any error messages or warnings

## Technical Details

### Log Storage
- Logs are stored in memory during app runtime
- Maximum 1000 entries by default (configurable)
- Logs are lost when app is closed (export to preserve)

### Performance Impact
- Minimal impact on app performance
- Log entries are limited to prevent memory issues
- Logging can be disabled if needed

### Integration Points
The logging system is integrated into:
- App initialization and lifecycle
- Audio recording operations
- Speech recognition pipeline
- Model management
- Error handling throughout the app

## Conclusion

The WhiteNoise logging system provides comprehensive visibility into app operations, making it easy to diagnose issues, monitor performance, and understand app behavior. Regular use of the logging system will help maintain optimal app performance and quickly resolve any issues that arise.
